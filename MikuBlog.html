                <h2>Vocaloid</h2>

                <p>Vocaloid is a voice synthesis software that enables musicians and producers to create songs using virtual voices instead of relying on human singers. The process involves recording a variety of vocal samples from real singers, which are then processed into a digital format that allows users to control every aspect of the voice. These virtual singers can be programmed to sing specific lyrics, melodies, and harmonies, with users controlling pitch, tone, tempo, and even emotional expression. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each voice in Vocaloid is personified by a character, like Hatsune Miku, who has become a virtual idol with her own fanbase. These characters aren’t just tools for creating music, but they also function as performers in their own right, often featured in concerts as holographic projections and in collaborations with real-world artists. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What makes Vocaloid particularly appealing is its accessibility for independent artists. Without the need to hire a singer, musicians can produce and release fully vocalized tracks, even if they don’t have the budget or resources for professional recording sessions. This has democratized music production and opened up new opportunities for creativity. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Vocaloid community is another important factor. Musicians from all over the world share their creations, remix each other’s work, and explore new genres. This collaborative environment has led to the emergence of entirely new musical styles and helped virtual singers gain a cultural following. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ultimately, Vocaloid offers both technical and creative freedom, allowing artists to produce professional-quality vocal performances without the limitations that come with live singers. It’s a tool that blends technology, music, and virtual performance, making it a groundbreaking platform in modern music production. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Vocaloid offers a level of precision and flexibility that human voices can’t always provide. Producers can fine-tune every note and syllable to fit their artistic vision.

                    Hatsune Miku was one of the first character personas developed by Crypton Future Media for their Vocaloid software. 
                    <br>
                    <br>                    
                    She debuted in 2007. Her name is from the Japanese characters for first, sound, and future, so her name means “first sound from the future.” According to her backstory, Hatsune Miku comes from a not-so-distant future where music was lost. She emerged as a 16-year-old singing android who reintroduced the skills to the world. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Part of the reason that Hatsune Miku is so popular is that she was created to be collaborative. The original illustrations of her are licensed under Creative Commons, and there’s a large community dedicated to creating and sharing songs for her. So far, Crypton Future Media boasts that over 100,000 songs have been produced using her vocal software. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is no "official" artist, label, band, or anything for Miku, instead, songs became so viral that they established themselves as classics, but every day people from around the globe makes and releases songs with Miku (even I fiddled with her voice some years ago). The thing is that the voice is so prominent on those songs, that the community treats it like if she was the artist, as we often hear the song for the use of the voicebank rather than the artist behind. That being said, there are some established Vocaloid producers, each one with it's own style, but all using Miku and/or other vocaloid voicebanks as their main "instrument.

                        Gumi Vocaloid is a well-known virtual singer and one of the most popular characters in the Vocaloid software series. With her unique voice and captivating performances, Gumi has captured the hearts of both casual listeners and hardcore fans alike.

                        <br>
                        She is one of the most popular Vocaloid after Miku, she holds the record of the most viewed Vocaloid song on Youtube. The song "Echo" by CircusP actually has 109 Million views on Youtube.

                        Kasane Teto is NOT a vocaloid like the other ones in this list. She is an Utauloid, a free version of the Vocaloid software. Utau is a website where everyone can make their own voicebank. Teto is the most popular Utau nowadays.

                        She started as an April Fools Joke as a parody of Hatsune Miku until she got so popular that got an official SynthV version.

                        Kaai Yuki was worked under the concept to faithfuly copy the voice of little girls. Her voicebank was provided by a elementary school girl and for legal reasons her name has never been revealed.

                        Megurine Luka is the product and character name of the speech synthesis and desktop music (DTM) software that was released by Crypton Future Media on January 30.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Luka was the first female bilingual Vocaloid, the first to have an English voicebank provided by a Japanese company, and the first Vocaloid2 by Crypton Future Media to be upgraded to the Vocaloid4 engine.
